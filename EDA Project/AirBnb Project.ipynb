It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide. For hosts, it's a way to earn money while protecting their property from potential damage. However, for guests, it's a risky venture that they should avoid.\n","\n","For this project we are analyzing Airbnb’s New York City(NYC) data. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.\n","\n","Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with interesting insights. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"},"source":["# **GitHub Link -**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"},"source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"},"source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"},"source":["**This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using Python language and it's libraries, to perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, review per month, and location-based trends.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PH-0ReGfmX4f"},"source":["#### **Define Your Business Objective?**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PhDvGCAqmjP1"},"source":["- The goal of the project - The purpose of the project is to gather information and analyze the detailed information of the different bookings in the neighborhood groups in order to provide insights about the bookings in a particular area as per your preference, type of rooms, and price accordingly.\n","- We have tried discovering relationships among different columns and found meaningful insights to decipher business impacts.\n","\n","### Data Cleaning ###\n","1.
